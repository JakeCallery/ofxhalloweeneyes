Halloween Display, dummy painting tracking people as they walk by (Uses Kinect Depth sensor)


Xbox Kinect used to get depth info, custom openframeworks software gets blob info,
generates likely bounding box for person walking by, aims virtual eyeballs as person in
3d space, send info over serial to arduino that drives servos that drives the eyeballs to
watch as the person walks by. Really pretty creepy.
